   title: 16 - Data for Epidemiology and Public Health, and Big Data11The questions
      posed by data processing for epidemiology and public health are often similar
      to those discussed in the chapters on clinical research (Chapter 18) and bioinformatics
      data (Chapter 17). For the sake of clarity, we address these questions in different
      chapters, although the problems are of the same nature and the solutions are
      isomorphic. In order to avoid too much repetition, the issue of big data is
      discussed here without going into the content of the other chapters.
